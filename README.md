# LinkClipper

## Description

This is just a simple MacOS application that can be used to copy links to the clipboard when opening any link. It's created with 2 main use cases in mind:

To get all the potential of the this application it's recommended to use LinkClipper with a clipboard manager application in Mac OS like:

- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
- [RayCast](https://raycast.com/)
- [Clipboard Center](https://clipboard.center/)
- [CopyClip](https://fiplab.com/apps/copyclip-for-mac)
- [Pasta](https://getpasta.com/)
- [Paste](https://pasteapp.io/)

### With Passthrough - Copying links from the browser

Adding this version of LinkClipper as the default browser, will make any link you open to go to the clipboard.

When you copy a link from the browser, it will be automatically copied to the clipboard. This is useful when you want to copy a link from the browser to another application, but you don't want to open the link in the browser.

### Only Copy - Copying links from any application

Same applications but this time this application only works as a way to copy links from any application. This is useful used in combination with [Choosy](https://choosy.app/), so we have a quick way to copy links from anywhere.
